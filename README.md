# OPS-Challenge
OPS IP Range Challenge 

Version: 1.0

Language: Java

## Introduction

This application serves as a IP information service that exposes one endpoint for users 
to access all the IP ranges for selectable regions from AWS ip ranges. It leverages a 
separate IP range datasource to provide accurate information.

## Endpoints

The application automatically makes a swagger-ui page available at http://server:port/swagger-ui.html 
(ex. http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui.html) with more detailed information for the endpoint. 

For basic endpoint information read the following:

1. **GET /api/v1/ip-management/range** - Get IP Range
- Returns the IP ranges for a specific region or all and requires the following paramter:
  - **region**: The region by which the data will be filtered (ex. EU, US, CA)

- Request URL

  ex: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ip-management/range?region=US

- **Response Text**

  `data:{"ip_prefix":"13.34.66.0/27","region":"us-east-1","service":"AMAZON","network_border_group":"us-east-1"}`
